## About
In this project, I was given the executable for the linux version of minesweeper and given the task to create a cheat for it in a class competition to see who could achieve the lowest time. There were some restrictions, but the premise is that the game still had to be playable. I used IDA to run through the assembly, not being allowed to look at source code, and had to come up with a unique cheat.  Running xdemineur (the linux version of minesweeper) in cheater.c will inject a cheat into the game for a game win condition in under two minutes.
